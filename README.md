# Programming Starter Pack <small>[Work in progress]</small>

This is a repository for collecting resources to learn programming.

Rhetorical Question: Why should we create our own materials instead of using existing ones?

So, let's gather all the 'best' programming resources here. Over time, we will see which resources are the best and which are not. Of course, what is considered the 'best' is subjective.

Optional topics are not necessary for junior-level knowledge, but they are good to know.

For programming first, you need to select a path.
You need to decide the programming language based on your goals,
what you want to achieve with programming, what you want to program.

For example, for hardware (physical things) programming, you need to learn one of them: C, C++, Rust, etc.
For frontend web development, you need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
For backend web development you need to learn one of them: JavaScript, Python, PHP, Java, C#, Go, Rust, etc.
With JavaScript, you can do frontend and backend development too, so it's a good start for web development.
For mobile development, you need to learn one of them: Java, Kotlin, Swift, Dart, etc.

# Web-programming starter pack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

For learning web-programming, you need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
You can learn them in any order, but I recommend learning HTML first, then CSS, then JavaScript.

- [HTML + CSS links](./html-css.md)
- [JavaScript links](./javascript.md)

## Linux / Bash / Command Line (CLI)

- For deploying web applications, you need to know how to use the command line.
- On servers, you will use Linux (most of the time), so you need to know how to use it.
- If you're lucky, then you can avoid learning command line.
  There are providers where you can deploy your application without using the command line.
